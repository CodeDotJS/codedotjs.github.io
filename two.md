### __Differnece or impact of vaccination in Low and High-Income Countries__

Vaccination has become the most effective public health measure for the control of infectious diseases after the provision
of clean drinking water. The history of vaccination is marked with great hopes and some disappointments.

In particular, the second half of the 20th century witnessed the development of remarkable vaccination projects. 
There is a possibility that polio and measles may be eradicated within a few years, but almost 3 million people – usually children!
5 years of age – die each year from diseases that are preventable by vaccines. 

Developing countries are struggling to get the vaccines to children who desperately need them. However,in Europe and North America, 
people have become complacent about vaccines: ‘these diseases are no longer a threat and the vaccine is more dangerous than the disease’.
Those misconceptions have caused outbreaks of measles, diphtheria and pertussis.

The international community must continue to devote the necessary resources, money and manpower to fully exploit the 
promise that vaccines hold for the relief of human misery.

### __Vaccination in low income countries.__

In spite of significant advances in science and technology, the 
implementation of global vaccination coverage remains a pipe dream.
Many obstacles and challenges remain, and imaginative and bold solutions are required. Recent initiatives based on international cooperation, philanthropy, and goodwill promise a brighter future for those in need living in the developing world 

- Challenges to Improving Vaccination

What are the challenges we face in implementing the scientific advances
to improve the effectiveness of vaccination as a primary preventive strategy against infectious disease? Clearly, the wider implementation of the currently available vaccines against the major disease that cause significant mortality and morbidity in the developing countries is a key challenge. 

Many of these vaccines have been licensed for more than 10 years, have been safe and efficacious, have been offered at low prices and yet have not been introduced as part of national mass immunization programs in many developing countries.

Political commitment to maintaining vaccination infrastructure in the face of competing priorities, and continued affordability of vaccines, needs to be maintained.

- Obstacles to Effective Vaccination

In addiation to the challenges, we also need to be aware of other, longstanding obstacles that need to be dealt with in order to achieve the ultimate goal of widespread immunization coverage against the major diseases. These obstacles are of four types: medical and scientific, structural and demographic, economic and political, and societal and cultural.

In relation to medical and scientific challenges, it is well known that many developing countries (with low-income criteria) have weak surveillance capabilities, limited data on disease burden, and a weak scientific base. The implication of this is that very often there is a lack of awareness that a problem even exists. Furthermore, any children in developing countries suffer from malnutrition.

Under structural obstacles, we find poor infrastructure, logistic problems, expanding populations, and diversity to be the effective delivery of vaccines.

As to societal and cultural issues, the major obstacles relate to poverty, illiteracy, religious taboos, superstition, the influence of tradition healers/shamans, and an overemphasis on curative, rather than preventive, medicine.

Clearly, the obstacles described in the various sectors are interrelated and will influence and interact with each other. The situation is also a dynamic one that is changing all the time.
