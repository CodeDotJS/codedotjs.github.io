	 WELCOME TO MY ARENA

	<br>
	<br>
	If you are wondering what you'll find here - well, there is nothing special!
	<br>
	Feel free to check my <a href="https://rishi.ml">website</a> in case you are curious to know about me.

	 NOTE 
	 </b>
	<br>
	<br>
	The website you'll be visiting is <a href="https://codedotjs.github.io"><code>codedotjs.github.io</code></a> and it will redirect you to the main website!
	But there are some cool stuff in this place but I don't exactly remember in which directory they are put in. So again, if you are curious to find something meaningful, clone the repository and dig into it. I hope you find something good!
