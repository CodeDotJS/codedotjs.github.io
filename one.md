## __Storage of Vaccine__

There are few immunization issues more important than the appropriate storage of vaccines. 
Vaccine-preventable disease rates have decreased in part because of proper storage of vaccines. 
Exposure of vaccines to temperatures outside the recommended ranges can decrease their potency and reduce the
 effectiveness and protection they provide. 

Using proper vaccine storage units can help prevent costly vaccine losses and the inadvertent administration of
compromised vaccines. CDC recommends stand-alone units, meaning self-contained units that either freeze or refrigerate,
and are suitable for vaccine storage. Studies demonstrated that stand-alone units maintain the required temperatures
better than combination units, particularly the freezer section of household, combination units. 
Maintaining the cold chain is really importat too.

### Few important steps that the necessary part of storage :


- `The Cold Chain:`

What’s the opposite of maintaining the cold chain? Breaking it by letting vaccines get too warm! The most confusing thing is that
for most vaccines (all the inactivated ones), cold means 35-46oF (2-8o C), which is basic refrigerator temperature. For the live
varicella vaccine, and the live, intranasal influenza vaccine, cold means frozen (5o F or lower or -15o C or lower); however, the live
MMR vaccine can be stored in either the freezer or the refrigerator. That’s why it is so critical to keep each vaccine in its proper
compartment. A simple sign on the refrigerator can remind you where each vaccine goes. (We’ve included a handy chart at the
end of this section, “Vaccine Handling Tips,” that you can post on your refrigerator unit to remind staff of the appropriate storage
temperatures and other basics of good vaccine management.) Note that when vaccines get too warm, you can’t tell by looking
or feeling if they have become nonviable. That’s why it’s so critical to monitor the temperatures inside your refrigerator and
freezer and make sure they are within the proper range. If the temperature goes out of range, it’s then critical to take proper
steps to respond to the situation. Now, if your health care setting has decided to start offering only, say, hepatitis B and hepatitis A
vaccinations, both inactivated, you will only need to pay attention to the instructions for refrigerated vaccines.

- `Know where to put which vaccines:`

Vaccines should always be stored in trays in the middle of the refrigerator or freezer, never in the doors. The reason for this is
that item stored in the door are frequently exposed to warm temperatures when the unit is opened.

Stabilizing temperatures and safeguarding the electrical supply to the refrigerator are another few important steps
that lead us to have a better storage for the vaccines.


`Conclusion -` 

Storage errors can cost thousands of dollars in wasted vaccine and revaccination. 
Errors can also result in the loss of patient confidence when repeat doses are required. 
Vaccine management, including proper storage procedures, is the basis on which good immunization practices are built.
Vaccines must be stored properly from the time they are manufactured until they are administered. Assuring vaccine
quality and maintaining the cold chain is a shared responsibility among manufacturers, distributors, public health staff,
and health-care providers.
